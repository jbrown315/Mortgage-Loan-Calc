<h1>Different Types of Loans</h1>
<h2>Simple Interest Loan</h2>
<p>A simple interest loan is a method of calculating interest based off a payment made over a period of time.
    The total amount you pay is the principal amount plus the interest that accrues over the duration of the loan.</p>
<span>$$i=Prt$$</span>
<p id="example">Example:</p>
<p>If I take out a loan of $5000 with a 10% monthly interest rate that will be payed in 5 years, the total amount of
    interest can be calculated. <ul><span><li>$$P = $5000$$</li><li>$$r = \frac{10\%}{1 \text{ month}}$$</li><li>$$t = 5 \text{ years}$$</li></span></ul>
    <span>$$r = \frac{10\%}{1\text{ month}} * \frac{12\text{ months}}{1\text{ year}} = \frac{120%}{1\text{ year}}$$</span>
    <span>$$i = ($5000) * (120\%) * (5 \text{ years})$$</span>
    <span>$$i = $30,000$$</span>></p>
<h2>Compound Interest Loan</h2>
<p>Unlike a simple interest loan, a compound interest loan charges interest on the interest. Rather than owing an interest
    rate on your principal amount, you owe the interest rate based on the principle and any other interest amount. The total amount
    owed is is increased by the interest rate which is taken off the total amount owed rather than your principal amount.</p>
<span>$$A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}$$</span>
<p id="example">Example:</p>
<p>If I take out a loan of $5000 with a 10% monthly interest rate that will be payed every year for 5 years, the total cost of
    the loan can be calculated. <ul><span><li>$$P = \text{Principal} = $5000$$</li><li>$$r = \text{rate} = 10\%$$</li><li>$$n = \text{payments per time period} = 12$$</li><li>$$t = \text{time period} = 5 \text{ years}$$</li></span></ul>
    <span>$$A = ($5000) * (1 + \frac{10\%}{12})^{(12)(5)}$$</span>
    <span>$$A = $8,227$$</span>></p>
<h2>Interest Only Loan</h2>
<p>In an Interest only loan, you pay a fixed amount of interest based on the principal amount. Then you pay that amount over
    the course of a designated time period.</p>
<span>$$A = \frac{P*r}{n}$$</span>
<p id="example">Example:</p>
<p>If I take out a loan of $5000 with a 10% interest rate that will be paid through 4 payments, the  cost of each loan payment can be calculated.
    <ul><span><li>$$P = \text{Principal} = $5000$$</li><li>$$r = \text{rate} = 10\%$$</li><li>$$n = \text{number of payments} = 4$$</li></span></ul>
    <span>$$A = \frac{$5000 * 10\%}{4}$$</span>
    <span>$$A = $125$$</span>></p>
