<h1>Different Types of Loans</h1>
<h2>Simple Interest Loan</h2>
<p>A simple interest loan is a method of calculating interest based off a payment made over a period of time.
    The total amount you pay is the principal amount plus the interest that accrues over the duration of the loan.</p>
$$i=Prt(\frac{$5000}{1 month})$$
<p>Example:</p>
<p>If I take out a loan of $5000 with a 10% monthly interest rate that will be payed in 5 years, the total amount of
    interest can be calculated. <ul><li>$$P = $5000$$</li><li>$$r = \frac{10\%}{1 month}$$</li><li>$$t = (12 months)*(5 years)$$</li></ul>
    $$i = (5000) * (0.10) * (60)$$
    $$i = $30,000$$</p>
<h2>Compound Interest Loan</h2>
<p>Unlike a simple interest loan, a compound interest loan charges interest on the interest. Rather than owing an interest
    rate on your principal amount, you owe the interest rate based on the principle and any other interest amount. </p>
<h2>Interest Only Loan</h2>
<p>In an Interest only loan, you pay a fixed amount of interest based on the principal amount. Then you pay that amount over
    the course of a designated time period. (P*r)/n n = number of times per year</p>
