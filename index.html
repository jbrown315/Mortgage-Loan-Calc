<h2>Simple Interest Loan</h2>
<p>A simple interest loan is a method of calculating interest based off a payment made over a period of time.
    The total amount you pay is the same period of time interest rate based off your principle amount multiplied
    by the period of time of payments. Formula is i = P * r * t</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<h2>Compound Interest Loan</h2>
<p>Unlike a simple interest loan, a compound interest loan charges interest on the interest. Rather than owing an interest
    rate on your principal amount, you owe the interest rate based on the principle and any other interest amount. </p>
<h2>Interest Only Loan</h2>
<p>In an Interest only loan, you pay a fixed amount of interest based on the principal amount. Then you pay that amount over
    the course of a designated time period. (P*r)/n n = number of times per year</p>
