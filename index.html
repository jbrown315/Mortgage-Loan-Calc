<h1>Different Types of Loans</h1>
<h2>Simple Interest Loan</h2>
<p>A simple interest loan is a method of calculating interest based off a payment made over a period of time.
    The total amount you pay is the principal amount plus the interest that accrues over the duration of the loan.</p>
<span>$$i=Prt$$</span>
<span>$$i = \text{Total Interest amount}$$</span>
<span>$$P = \text{Principal}$$</span>
<span>$$r = \text{Interest Rate}$$</span>
<span>$$t = \text{Time period}$$</span>
<p class="example">Example:</p>
<p>If I take out a loan of $5000 with a 10% monthly interest rate that will be payed in 5 years, the total amount of
    interest can be calculated. <ul><span><li>$$P = $5000$$</li><li>$$r = \frac{10\%}{1 \text{ month}}$$</li><li>$$t = 5 \text{ years}$$</li></span></ul>
    <span>$$r = \frac{10\%}{1\text{ month}} * \frac{12\text{ months}}{1\text{ year}} = \frac{120%}{1\text{ year}}$$</span>
    <span>$$i = ($5000) * (120\%) * (5 \text{ years})$$</span>
    <span>$$i = $30,000$$</span>
    <span>$$\text{Total Cost} = $35,000$$</span>
    <span>$$\text{Monthly Payment} = $35,000/60\text{ months} = $583.33$$</span></p>

<h2>Compound Interest Loan</h2>
<p>Unlike a simple interest loan, a compound interest loan charges interest total amount owed. Rather than owing an interest
    rate on your principal amount, you owe the interest from the total amount. The total amount owed is is increased by the
    interest rate. You will be charged a monthly rate to pay off the loan based on the formula below. </p>
<span>$$x = \frac{P*(\frac{r}{n})}{(1-(1+\frac{r}{n})^{-n*t})}$$</span>
<span>$$x = \text{Monthly Payment}$$</span>
<span>$$P = \text{Principal}$$</span>
<span>$$r = \text{Interest Rate}$$</span>
<span>$$n = \text{Payments per time period}$$</span>
<span>$$t = \text{Time period}$$</span>
<p class="example">Example:</p>
<p>If I take out a loan of $5000 with a 10% annual interest rate compounded monthly for 3 years, the monthly cost of
    the loan can be calculated.
    <ul>
        <span><li>$$P = $5000$$</li>
            <li>$$r = 10\%$$</li>
            <li>$$n = 36$$</li>
            <li>$$t = 3 \text{ years}$$</li></span>
    </ul>
    <span>$$x = \frac{$5000 * (\frac{10\%}{36})}{(1-(1+\frac{10\%}{36})^{-36*3})}$$</span>
    <span>$$x = $53.65$$</span></p>
<h2>Interest Only Loan</h2>
<p>In an Interest only loan, you pay a fixed amount of interest based on the principal amount. Then you pay that amount over
    the course of a designated time period.</p>
<span>$$A = \frac{P*r}{n}$$</span>
<p class="example">Example:</p>
<p>If I take out a loan of $5000 with a 10% interest rate that will be paid through 4 payments, the  cost of each loan payment can be calculated.
    <ul><span><li>$$P = \text{Principal} = $5000$$</li><li>$$r = \text{rate} = 10\%$$</li><li>$$n = \text{number of payments} = 4$$</li></span></ul>
    <span>$$A = \frac{$5000 * 10\%}{4}$$</span>
    <span>$$A = $125$$</span>></p>
